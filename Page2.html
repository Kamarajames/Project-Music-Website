    The musical ages of modern man: how our taste in music changes over a lifetime
</div>
<br>
<p>New research charting broad shifts in changing personal music tastes during our lifetimes 
finds that - while it’s intrinsically linked to personality and experience - there are 
common music genre trends associated with key stages in a human life.</p>
<p>The explosion in music consumption over the last century has made ‘what you listen to’ 
an important personality construct – as well as the root of many social and cultural tribes
– and, for many people, their self-perception is closely associated with musical preference.
We would perhaps be reluctant to admit that our taste in music alters - softens even 
- as we get older.Whereas the first musical age is about asserting independence, the next appears to be more
about gaining acceptance from others</p>
<p>Jason Rentfrow</p>
<br>
<p>Now, a new study suggests that - while our engagement with it may decline - music stays 
important to us as we get older, but the music we like adapts to the particular 
‘life challenges’ we face at different stages of our lives.
It would seem that, unless you die before you get old, your taste in music will probably change
to meet social and psychological needs.One theory put forward by researchers, based on the study, is that we come to music to 
experiment with identity and define ourselves, and then use it as a social vehicle to establish
 our group and find a mate, and later as a more solitary expression of our intellect, status 
 and greater emotional understanding.</p>

<p>Researchers say the study is the first to “comprehensively document” the ways people engage 
with music “from adolescence to middle age”. The study is published in the Journal of 
Personality and Social Psychology.
Using data gathered from more than a quarter of a million people over a ten year period,
 
researchers divided musical genres into</p>

and plotted the patterns of preference across age-groups
</div>


<br>
<div class = "BoldHeadingBlue">
These five categories 
</div>
<p>incorporate multiple genres that share common musical and psychological 
traits - such as loudness and complexity.</p>


<p>“The project started with a common conception that musical taste does not evolve after 
young adulthood. Most academic research to date supported this claim, but - based on other 
areas of psychological research and our own experiences - we were not convinced this was the
 case,” said Arielle Bonneville-Roussy from Cambridge’s Department of Psychology, who led the
 study.</p>

<p>The study found that, unsurprisingly, the first great musical age is adolescence - defined by
 a short, sharp burst of ‘intense’ and the start of a steady climb of ‘contemporary’. ‘Intense’
 music - such as punk and metal - peaks in adolescence and declines in early adulthood, while
 ‘contemporary’ music - such as pop and rap - begins a rise that plateaus until early middle 
 age. </p>
 
<p>“Teenage years are often dominated by the need to establish identity, and music is a cheap,
 effective way to do this,” said Dr Jason Rentfrow, senior researcher on the study.
“Adolescents’ quest for independence often takes the shape of a juxtaposed stance to the 
perceived ‘status quo’, that of parents and the establishment. ‘Intense’ music, seen as 
aggressive, tense and characterised by loud, distorted sounds has the rebellious connotations 
that allow adolescents to stake a claim for the autonomy that is one of this period’s key 
‘life challenges’.”</p>

<p>As ‘intense’ gives way to the rising tide of ‘contemporary’ and introduction of ‘mellow’ 
– such as electronic and R & B – in early adulthood, the next musical age emerges. These two 
“preference dimensions” are considered “romantic, emotionally positive and danceable,” write 
the researchers.</p> 
 
<p>“Once people overcome the need for autonomy, the next ‘life challenge’ concerns finding love 
and being loved – people who appreciate this ‘you’ that has emerged,” said Rentfrow.
“What we took away from the results is that these forms of music reinforce the desire for 
intimacy and complement settings where people come together with the goal of establishing 
close relationships – parties, bars, clubs and so on.
“Whereas the first musical age is about asserting independence, the next appears to be more 
about gaining acceptance from others.”</p>

<p>As we settle down and middle age begins to creep in, the last musical age, as identified by 
the researchers, is dominated by ‘sophisticated’ – such as jazz and classical – and 
‘unpretentious’ – such as country, folk and blues.</p>   
<p>Researchers write that both these dimensions are seen as “positive and relaxing” - with 
‘sophisticated’ indicating the complex aesthetic of high culture that could be linked 
to social status and perceived intellect, while ‘unpretentious’ echoes sentiments of family, 
love and loss – emotionally direct music that speaks to the experiences most will have had by 
this life stage.</p>

<p>“As we settle into ourselves and acquire more resources to express ourselves – career, home, 
family, car – music remains an extension of this, and at this stage there are aspects of 
wanting to promote social status, intellect and wealth that play into the increased gravitation 
towards ‘sophisticated’ music,” said Rentfrow, “as social standing is seen as a key ‘life 
challenge’ to be achieved by this point”.</p>

<p>“At the same time, for many this life stage is frequently exhausted by work and family, and 
there is a requirement for relaxing, emotive music for those rare down times that reflects the
 other major ‘life challenge’ of this stage – that of nurturing a family and maintaining 
 long-term relationships, perhaps the hardest of all.” </p>  
 
<p>Adds Bonneville-Roussy:
“Due to our very large sample size, gathered from online forms and 
social media channels, we were able to find very robust age trends in musical taste. I find it
 fascinating to see how seemingly trivial behaviour such as music listening relates to so many 
 psychological aspects, such as personality and age.”</p>

<p>"From early childhood, I attended specialised classical music schools. Together with my school 
friends, I grew up with the idea that Beethoven and Debussy were cool. I was clearly an outlier.
 During adolescence, although I still preferred classical music, I used to listen to pop music 
 such as the Spice girls and Madonna to please my ‘non-classical’ friends. I would go out with 
 my friends and would shape my taste according to the latest trends I would hear.
"During adolescence, my musical preferences would change according to those of my 
‘non-classical’ friends, going from teen pop to rap plus R and B, and then later rock and funk. 
My taste for mellow, contemporary and intense music would last until I entered university, 
where I could freely display my true preference for classical music once and for all."</p>

<div class = "BoldHeadingBlue1">
<p>Jason Rentfrow</p>
</div>
<p>“I definitely liked loud, raw music that concerned my parents during adolescence – Rage 
against the Machine, Ministry, Jane’s Addiction, Beastie Boys were all staples of my teenage 
years. I was in a lot of bands and used to play the drums, I definitely enjoyed making 
serious amounts of noise!”</p>
<p>“I loved going to dance clubs and was very into drum and bass in early adulthood. 
I also really enjoyed salsa music and me and my girlfriend of the time (now my wife) 
would spend a lot of evenings going out dancing. I also really enjoyed a band called Phish,
 who specialised in extended improvised jams - great for long, late night conversations.  
"I’m still a fair way off middle age! But, I can certainly see similar patterns emerging.</p> 
<p>Jazz became increasingly important to me in my twenties and thirties – particularly John Coltrane
– but it’s really demanding stuff, and with a 14 month old baby things are a lot more hectic 
now and I don’t have so much time to invest in such rigorous music.
"Interestingly, I have noticed I’ve begun to develop more appreciation for country music. I 
grew up in Texas, and always hated country music and its fans – we used to call them ‘
sh*tkickers’, the guys with boots and hats. But while I don’t listen to the mainstream 
‘stadium’ country, certainly Johnny Cash, Townes Van Zandt and even some types of bluegrass 
have become more appealing of late."</p>
