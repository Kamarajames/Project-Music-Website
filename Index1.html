<p>I read three articles about the changing taste of music and how this develops as you age,
each article is placed on a different page 2, 3 and 4 respectively and hopely you will enjoy reading them as much as I did. It certainly
gave me a whole new perspective on music and how we develop with it as we age. The whole aim of this site is for anyone  
to take there own journey into their musical taste and develop their own understanding of their  musical interest. You can read the 
articles as and when you want too and if you feel like sending me some feedback please fill out a feed back form via the review button 
at the top of this page giving your own comments on what you enjoy musically. A link for a facebook oldies music fan is also provided if 
you so wish to enjoy music with other like minded people. These are the three articles below:</p>

<!--Here change this to ordered list 04.12.2015-->
<div class = "BoldHeadingRed5">
<p>The musical ages of modern man: how our taste in music changes over a lifetime</p>
</div>
<div class = "BoldHeadingRed5">
<p>Musical tastes offer a window into how you think</p>
</div>
<div class = "BoldHeadingRed5">
<p>Rock of Ages: Taste in music DOES change over a lifetime</p>
</div>

<p>Take time to read and think about these interesting articles, they all point to same final 
overall conclusion that our musical taste 
<div class = "BoldHeadingBlue1">
<p>DOES change as we get older. </p> 
</div>
 
<p>Included in the following pages are various musical
periods going from the 50s to the 60s, 70s to the 80s and finally from the 90s to 00s. The reason I selected these years was 
because of my own experience of growing up with this music and the influence it had on me from an early age, through what my
parents played to me too etc, to my teenage rebellious years and friends, to my coming of age 
at University and to my working adult life, so its just my own personal selection. If there is music that 
you have particular interest in from any other culture, then please just fill out the review feedback form, the Review link is just above, and explain why,
it would be nice to hear your views.</p> 
<p>The REVIEW BUTTON, just mentioned, is at the top of each page which gives you the opportunity to say what music year or years
you felt influenced you the most as you grew up and what your personal choice is now.
There are various videos to enjoy in own time, if you enjoyed them and would like to know more
about the history of music over certain years feel free to check the links at the bottom of 
each page. You can check the Facebook Music fan club or the People's History of Music for the 
various musical time periods, certainly I enjoyed it and I hope you too will enjoy reading 
the articles and get to understand your own musical age experience.</p>
<p>There is a video in this home page, just below, that you may enjoy or certainly find it entertaining as it 
looks at someone elses take on the musical age of taste from a fun point of view.
If you do decide to give some feedback please just click on the review button at the top of each page
and just indicate what you enjoy. I also have a Contact Address
