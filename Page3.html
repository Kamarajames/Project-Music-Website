Musical tastes offer a window into how you think
</div>
<p>Do you like your jazz to be Norah Jones or Ornette Coleman, your classical music to be Bach 
or Stravinsky, or your rock to be Coldplay or Slayer? The answer could give an insight into 
the way you think, say researchers from the University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>In a study published today in the journal PLOS ONE, a team of psychologists show that your 
thinking style – whether you are an ‘empathizer’ who likes to focus on and respond to the 
emotions of others, or a ‘systemizer’ who likes to analyse rules and patterns in the world—is 
a predictor of the type of music you like.</p>

<p>Although people’s music choices fluctuates over time, we’ve discovered a person’s empathy 
levels and thinking style predicts what kind of music they like
In a study published today in the journal PLOS ONE, a team of psychologists show that your 
thinking style – whether you are an ‘empathizer’ who likes to focus on and respond to the 
emotions of others, or a ‘systemizer’ who likes to analyse rules and patterns in the world—is a
 predictor of the type of music you like.</p>
 
<p>Music is a prominent feature of everyday life and nearly everywhere we go. It’s easy for us to
 know what types of music we like and don’t like. When shuffling songs on an iPod, it takes us 
 only a few seconds to decide whether to listen or skip to the next track. However, little is 
 known about what determines our taste in music.</p>
 
<p>Researchers over the past decade have argued that musical preferences reflect explicit 
characteristics such as age and personality. For example, people who are open to new 
experiences tend to prefer music from the blues, jazz, classical, and folk genres, and 
people who are extraverted and ‘agreeable’ tend to prefer music from the pop, soundtrack,
 religious, soul, funk, electronic, and dance genres.</p>
 <div class = "image">
 <p><a href="https://youtu.be/lgCZN1rU5co"><img src="images/NewSpecialsimage.jpe" alt="Specials image" style="float: left;  width:150; height: 150;"></a></p>
 </div>
 <p>Now a team of scientists, led by PhD student David Greenberg, has looked at how our ‘cognitive
 style’ influences our musical choices. This is measured by looking at whether an individual 
 scores highly on ‘empathy’ (our ability to recognize and react to the thoughts and feelings 
 of others) or on ‘systemizing’ (our interest in understanding the rules underpinning systems
 such as the weather, music, or car engines) – or whether we have a balance of both.</p>
 
<p>“Although people’s music choices fluctuates over time, we’ve discovered a person’s empathy 
levels and thinking style predicts what kind of music they like,” said David Greenberg from 
the Department of Psychology. “In fact, their cognitive style – whether they’re strong on
 empathy or strong on systems – can be a better predictor of what music they like than their 
 personality.”</p>
 
<p>The researchers conducted multiple studies with over 4,000 participants, who were recruited 
mainly through the myPersonality Facebook app. The app asked Facebook users to take a selection
 of psychology-based questionnaires, the results of which they could place on their profiles 
 for other users to see. At a later date, they were asked to listen to and rate 50 musical 
 pieces. The researchers used library examples of musical stimuli from 26 genres and subgenres,
 to minimise the chances that participants would have any personal or cultural association with
 the piece of music.</p>
 
<p>People who scored high on empathy tended to prefer mellow music (from R and B, soft rock, and
 adult contemporary genres), unpretentious music (from country, folk, and singer/songwriter
 genres) and contemporary music (from electronica, Latin, acid jazz, and Euro pop). They 
 disliked intense music, such as punk and heavy metal. In contrast, people who scored high 
 on systemizing favoured intense music, but disliked mellow and unpretentious musical styles.
The results proved consistent even within specified genres: empathizers preferred mellow, 
unpretentious jazz, while systemizers preferred intense, sophisticated (complex and avant-garde) jazz.</p>

<p>The researchers then looked more in-depth and found those who scored high on empathy preferred 
music that had low energy (gentle, reflective, sensual, and warm elements), or negative emotions
 (sad and depressing characteristics), or emotional depth (poetic, relaxing, and thoughtful
 features). Those who scored high on systemizing preferred music that had high energy (strong,
 tense, and thrilling elements), or positive emotions (animated and fun features), and which 
 also featured a high degree of cerebral depth and complexity.</p>
 
<p>David Greenberg, a trained jazz saxophonist, says the research could have implications for the 
music industry. “A lot of money is put into algorithms to choose what music you may want to 
listen to, for example on Spotify and Apple Music. By knowing an individual’s thinking style, 
such services might in future be able to fine tune their music recommendations to an individual.”
Dr Jason Rentfrow, the senior author on the study says: “This line of research highlights how
 music is a mirror of the self. Music is an expression of who we are emotionally, socially, 
 and cognitively.”</p>
 
<p>Professor Simon Baron-Cohen, a member of the team, added; “This new study is a fascinating 
extension to the ‘empathizing-systemizing’ theory of psychological individual differences. 
It took a talented PhD student and musician to even think to pose this question. The research 
may help us understand those at the extremes, such as people with autism, who are strong 
systemizers.”</p>
